Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

It is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. (Yasar, 2024)


What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

While programming is centered around code, software engineering is extended over the entire lifecycle of the software, from conception to maintenance, emphasizing a structured and methodical approach to software development.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Planning - define the projects purpose and desired result
Requirements – determine what is required for the project
Design and Prototype – design phase defines how a software application will work. A prototype is a basic idea of how the application looks and works.
Software development – start to develop the programme
Testing – test the written code prior to moving to the next coding task
Deployment – once certain that there are no bugs then you need to move to the deployment of the programme or code.
Maintenance – run maintenance checks to ensure that nothing was missed during the deployment phase.


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

Waterfall Model: A step-by-step method where each stage must be finalized prior to the commencement of the subsequent one. Agile Methodology: Focuses on flexibility and customer satisfaction by continuously delivering functional software components.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Requirements Engineering is the practice of defining software manuscripts with sustaining requirement specification and its activities. It involves tasks such as requirement analysis, elicitation, documentation, conciliation, and validation.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Modularity in software design is a technique where complex software is divided into smaller, independent modules, such as functions, classes, or components. It facilitates easier management and understanding of complex systems by breaking them down into digestible parts.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

Unit Testing
•	Unit testing is when every module of the application gets tested respectively.
•	Unit testing is done by the developer himself. After he has written code for a feature, he will ensure it is working fine.
•	Unit tests are the smallest testable component of the application.
•	Nowadays we have Junit, Pytest, and TestNg frameworks for unit testing the application.
Integration Testing
•	Integration testing is a testing technique where two or more independent components are tested together.
•	Integration testing is done by the developer. Here test cases are written to ensure the data flowing between them is correct.
•	For example, testing the signup form where UI validations are correct, data reaching API, and getting stored are all validated.
•	Integration testing is done when the application is still developing to find bugs early on in the development process.
System Testing
•	System testing is done by the tester where the entire application is tested as a single unit.
•	Hence, system testing test cases are also performance test cases, load testing, and stress testing test cases.
•	System testing is done to find the errors which might have been overlooked during unit or integration testing.
•	System testing evaluates both functional and non-functional test cases.
Acceptance Testing
•	Acceptance testing is done by the client where he evaluates whether the product is made by the requirement he listed out.
•	Acceptance testing is done at the UAT server where a well-tested product is deployed by the team for the client's reference so he can track ongoing changes in the project
•	There is a defined acceptance criterion that is laid at the time of requirement listing so that the client can validate that the product is meeting the acceptance criteria.
•	Once the client completes acceptance testing the product goes to production where users can use the final application


What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

•	Managing people: Acts as a project leader. Communication with stakeholders. Manages human resources.
•	Managing project: Monitors progress and performance. Risk analysis at every phase. Manages time and budget constraint.


Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs. Software maintenance is done after the product has launched for several reasons including improving the software overall, correcting issues or bugs, to boost performance, and more.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Privacy, accuracy, property, accessibility, and effects on quality of life, are all issues that must be considered in developing and delivering computer software systems. Choosing a particular approach to system development can either hinder or facilitate addressing these issues in an ethical manner.

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
